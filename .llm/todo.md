## Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Minimal** | Remove visual clutter, simplified UI chrome |
| **Light-lined** | Thin borders (border-gray-100/200), subtle dividers |
| **Contrast-driven depth** | Subtle shadows for elevation, not heavy backgrounds |
| **Restrained color** | Muted primary, accent only for key actions |
| **Clean whitespace** | Generous padding, breathing room between elements |

## Context for Execution

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS 4 (with @theme inline directive)
- TypeScript
- next-intl for i18n

**Key Files:**
- `src/app/globals.css` - Design tokens and base styles
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Main navigation
- `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` - Page wrapper
- `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` - Homepage
- `src/app/[locale]/auth/*.tsx` - Auth pages
- `src/app/[locale]/rides/*.tsx` - Ride pages
- `src/app/[locale]/bookings/page.tsx` - Bookings page
- `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/*.tsx` - Dashboard pages

**Current Styling Approach:**
- CSS variables in :root for theming
- Tailwind @theme inline for custom colors
- Inline Tailwind classes throughout components
- Uses `cn()` utility from clsx + tailwind-merge

**Design Direction Notes:**
- Current: `--primary: #2563eb` (saturated blue) → Use more muted/sophisticated blue
- Current: Heavy borders with `border-input` → Lighter, more subtle
- Current: `bg-muted` for backgrounds → Subtle shadows for depth instead
- Current: Basic rounded-lg → Consistent border radius system
- Add transition animations for polish
- Focus states should be subtle but visible

## Summary

- **Tasks:** 14 items
- **Estimated complexity:** Medium
- **Key areas affected:** globals.css, Header, all page components
